In this text we grouped many of the theory behind AI models used in this repository.

## How diffusion models work

A **diffusion model** is a type of generative AI that creates images or videos through an iterative denoising process. During training, the model learns how to recover visual information from data that has been progressively corrupted with random noise. During generation, it performs the reverse operation, starting from noise and gradually refining it over many steps into coherent visual content guided by conditioning inputs such as text prompts, images, or other control signals. This approach enables diffusion models to produce highly detailed and visually consistent results.
